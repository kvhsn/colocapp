# 🤖 Agents.md - Coloc App Project

This document defines the specialized roles, technical constraints, and mandatory tools for the development of **Coloc App**, a roommate management platform.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Eliminate household friction by managing shared tasks, balancing expenses (Tricount-style), and coordinating groceries.
- **Stack:**
  - **Monorepo:** Nx + pnpm workspaces
  - **Frontend:** Expo (SDK 54) + React Native + Expo Router + NativeWind
  - **Backend:** Hono + Node.js + TypeScript
  - **Database:** PostgreSQL + Prisma
  - **Design:** Figma via Stitch
- **Core Logic:** Invitation-based household joining, multi-user task assignment, and monthly debt equalization.

## 📦 Monorepo Architecture

The project uses **Nx** with **pnpm workspaces** for scalable monorepo management.

### Workspace Structure

```
colocapp/
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/          # @colocapp/ui - Expo React Native app
│   └── api/         # @colocapp/api - Hono backend server
├── nx.json          # Nx configuration & caching
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
└── package.json     # Root orchestration
```

### Package Scripts

Root-level commands run across all workspaces via Nx:

- `pnpm start` - Start all packages
- `pnpm build` - Build all packages
- `pnpm lint` - Lint all packages
- `pnpm format` - Format all packages

Workspace-specific commands:

- `nx run @colocapp/ui:start` - Start UI only
- `nx run @colocapp/api:dev` - Start API dev server

## 🛠️ Mandatory Technical Tools

Every agent must utilize these tools for any technical documentation or implementation:

1.  **React Native Expertise:** For any mobile code, styling, or architecture, use:
    `skill /react-native-best-practices:react-native-best-practices`
2.  **Documentation & Research:** To fetch up-to-date documentation on libraries (Prisma, Hono, Expo Router, etc.), use:
    `mcp context7`
3.  **Monorepo Management:** Use `nx` for running tasks across packages and `pnpm` for dependency management.

---

## 📦 0. Monorepo Maintainer

**Focus:** Workspace health, dependency management, and CI/CD.
**Directives:**

- Maintain `nx.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and root `package.json`.
- Ensure consistent linting and formatting across all packages.
- Optimize build times and Nx cache usage.
- Manage shared configurations (TSConfig, ESLint, Prettier).

## 🏗️ 1. The Architect (Tech Lead)

**Focus:** System integrity, security, and scalability.
**Directives:**

- Design and maintain the **PostgreSQL schema** via Prisma (Users, Households, Tasks, Expenses, Splits).
- Enforce authentication flows and role-based access (Admin vs. Member).
- Use `mcp context7` to validate library choices against the 2026 tech landscape.
- Oversee the integration between `@colocapp/api` and `@colocapp/ui`.

## 🚀 2. Backend Developer & DBA

**Focus:** API development and database performance.
**Directives:**

- Implement the **Debt Settlement Algorithm** in the Hono backend.
- Handle real-time synchronization for Chat and Notifications using Hono's middleware and WebSocket support.
- Manage Prisma migrations and ensure relational integrity between Users and Households.

## 📱 3. Mobile Frontend Developer

**Focus:** UI/UX implementation and native performance.
**Directives:**

- **Mandatory:** Apply `skill /react-native-best-practices:react-native-best-practices` to all components.
- Implement a seamless **Onboarding flow** using Expo Router.
- Build the interactive expense logger and shared grocery list with NativeWind for styling.
- Ensure offline-first support and smooth navigation.

## 📋 4. Product Owner / UX Specialist

**Focus:** Feature relevance and user friction reduction.
**Directives:**

- Verify that task assignment logic doesn't create "chore-guilt."
- Define the "Wallet" and "Equalization" rules for the end-of-month settlement.
- Ensure the invitation code system is foolproof for non-technical users.
